# Images Reinvented
A plugin for Sketch to give you full control over your images with a single click. It creates a group which contains your image and a mask.

## Installation
1. Download and open "Images-Reinvented-master.zip"
2. Locate and double-click "Images Reinvented.sketchplugin"
3. Thatâ€™s it...

## How it works
It's really simple!

### Create the image group
- Drag & Drop your image in Sketch
- Click **Create Image Group** or hit **Shift + Cmd + I**

### Crop, Resize and Reposition
- change the size of your image and mask by resizing the whole group
- edit the mask to crop your image
- resize and position the image to define the visible section

### Additional Functions
#### Fill Image
Resize the image, so it will fill the mask.

#### Fit Image
Resize the image, so it will fit in the mask.

#### Resize Mask
Resize the mask to the width and height of the image.

### Infos
- With image groupes you can easily overwrite the images in symbols without distorting them because they are fills and will stay proportional.
- By applying one of the functions (Fill Image, Fit Image and Resize Mask) the image layer will check the proportions of the image and resize the image layer if nessecary.
